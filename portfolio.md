## Stay Focused (C#, Console App.)

<img src="{{ 'assets/img/StayFocused.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="" />

Stay Focused is a simple console application that looks at what program you are using every five minutes. If it isn't on the whitelist (allowed list) then it will popup telling you to do something more productive. You can check it out on my [repo](https://github.com/ElysRealm/Stay-Focused).

## The Vertex Whisperer (C#, Unity)

The Vertex Whisperer was a prototype that I made in Unity quite a while ago. The core mechanic is being able to grab vertices and manipulate them in real time. You can check out the code for that [here](https://github.com/ElysRealm/The-Vertex-Whisperer-Core-Manipulator-Code).
