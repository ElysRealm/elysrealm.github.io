My name is Eric BeCude-McWilliams. Some skills I posses:

- Intermediate C# Programming - I am proficient in C# but I still have a good deal to learn.
- Unity 3D - I have made a handful of prototypes. One of which can be found over on my portfolio tab.

### My story

My journey into programming began when I found out that I could make games. Like a lot of people in my particular age range, I started with Unity and learned the basics of C# along with it. I still have a fondness for game development but I'd like to expand my horizons into other areas, such as web design and maybe embedded programming too, eventually.
